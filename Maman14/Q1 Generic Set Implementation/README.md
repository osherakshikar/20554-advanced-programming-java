# 🧩 Maman14 Question 1: Generic Set Implementation

## 📝 Overview
This is my solution for Question 1 of Maman14 assignment from the Advanced Programming in Java course (20554), implementing a generic set data structure.

## 📋 Description
This project implements a generic set data structure in Java that can store any type of objects. The implementation includes basic set operations like union, intersection, subset checking, and element manipulation. Additionally, it includes a utility to find the minimum element in a set.

## 🔧 Implementation Details
- ✨ Generic set implementation supporting any object type
- 🔀 Basic set operations (union, intersection, subset checking)
- ⚡ Element manipulation (insert, delete, membership checking)
- 🔁 Iterator support for traversing elements
- 📊 Utility method to find minimum element in a set

## 🧱 Key Components
- `GenericSet<T>`: 🏗️ Core class implementing the generic set functionality
- `FindMinimum`: 🔍 Utility class with a generic method to find the minimum element
- `Person`: 👤 Example class implementing Comparable interface for testing
- `Main`: 🚀 Demonstration of set operations with both Integer and Person objects

## ✨ Features
- 🆕 Creation of sets from arrays or empty sets
- 🔄 Union operation to combine two sets
- 🔀 Intersection operation between sets
- ⊂ Subset checking
- ➕ Element insertion and deletion
- ✓ Membership checking
- ⬇️ Minimum element finding for comparable objects

## 🚀 How to Run
1. 📥 Clone this repository
2. 📂 Navigate to the project directory
3. 🛠️ Compile the Java files: `javac *.java`
4. ▶️ Run the main class: `java Main`
5. 📱 Follow the prompts to interact with the sets
