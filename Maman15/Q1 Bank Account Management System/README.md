# 🏦 Maman15 Question 1: Bank Account Management System

## 📝 Overview
This is my solution for Question 1 of Maman15 assignment from the Advanced Programming in Java course (20554), implementing a multi-threaded bank account management system.

## 📋 Description
This program simulates a bank system where multiple bank clerks (threads) process transactions from a shared transaction pool. The system handles deposits and withdrawals for multiple bank accounts concurrently, demonstrating thread synchronization and management in Java.

## 🔧 Implementation Details
- 🧵 Multi-threaded application with 10 clerk threads processing transactions
- 🔒 Thread-safe transaction pool shared between clerks
- 💰 Bank account operations (deposits and withdrawals)
- 🎲 Random transaction generation
- 🔄 Proper thread synchronization to prevent race conditions

## 🧩 Key Components
- `Bank`: 🏢 Main class that initializes accounts, transactions, and clerk threads
- `BankAccount`: 💳 Represents individual bank accounts with synchronized operations
- `TransactionPool`: 📊 Contains transactions to be processed by clerks
- `BankClerk`: 👨‍💼 Thread class that processes transactions from the pool

## 🚀 How to Run
1. 📥 Clone this repository
2. 📂 Navigate to the project directory
3. 🛠️ Compile the Java files: `javac *.java`
4. ▶️ Run the main class: `java Bank`
