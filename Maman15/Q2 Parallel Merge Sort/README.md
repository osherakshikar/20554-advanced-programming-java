# 🔄 Maman15 Question 2: Parallel Merge Sort

## 📝 Overview
This is my solution for Question 2 of Maman15 assignment from the Advanced Programming in Java course (20554), implementing a parallel merge sort algorithm.

## 📋 Description
This program demonstrates a multi-threaded approach to the merge sort algorithm. It creates an array of random integers and sorts them using multiple threads that work in parallel, merging arrays from a shared pool until a single sorted array remains.

## 🔧 Implementation Details
- 🧵 Multi-threaded merge sort implementation
- 🔒 Thread-safe shared array pool
- ⚖️ Dynamic workload distribution among threads
- 🔄 Concurrent merging of sub-arrays

## 🧩 Key Components
- `Main`: 🚀 Initializes the arrays, creates threads, and controls program flow
- `ArrayPool`: 📦 Thread-safe container for managing arrays being processed
- `MergeThread`: 🧠 Thread class that handles merging of arrays from the pool

## ✨ Features
- 🔢 User can specify the number of elements (n) in the initial array
- 👥 User can specify the number of threads (m) to use for sorting
- 🎲 Random generation of integer values between 1-100
- 📊 Visual display of initial arrays and final sorted result

## 🚀 How to Run
1. 📥 Clone this repository
2. 📂 Navigate to the project directory
3. 🛠️ Compile the Java files: `javac *.java`
4. ▶️ Run the main class: `java Main`
5. 💬 Follow the prompts to enter array size and thread count
